# Chibi Buddy

This is a pretty incomplete project, but it works mostly for what I wanted it for.

This is a Windows direct2d app that renders a bitmap to the screen.

Current features:
    - She bounces
    - You can move her around 

## Todo:
-   Get better at drawing
-   Finish the tray icon thing and run it as a service
-   Set up a tray custimization menu
-   More ways to display animations
-   Upload to steam and make moneyzz

## Future goals:
-   Implement api access to a NLP and a dialogue system so she can be your little friend (like bonzibuddy but better/cuter)
-   Set up an interface to easily custimize and create new bitmap characters
-   More system control so it can execute apps and send emails, etc. (ik, another vector for hax but i think its cool)


Sorry, it might take me a while to finish this; I've been enjoying linux lately.
